Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a most common neurodegenerative disease in this age. 
The early phase symptom is mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with memory loss. However, not all MCI patients will progress to AD. 
It is extremely important to discriminate the MCI patients who are at the risk of AD and those who are not as early as possible. 
The former patients can receive timely and correct treatment and the later ones can avoid unnecessary mistreatment. 
The project aims to develop a novel deep learning architecture identifying MCI patients who have a high likelihood of developing AD within 3 years. 
The deep learning procedures combine structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demographic, neuropsychological, and genetic data as input measures. 
The most novel characteristics of the machine learning model compared to previous ones are multi-tasking and fewer parameters. 
All analyses were performed on a subset of the database made publicly available via the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative http://adni.loni.usc.edu/.
